						<p>Our ambition is to build this into a series of workshops, targeting a different research
							community outside visualization each year,
							and eventually create a provenance research network that connects all the relevant
							communities.</p>
						<p>For this year, we will target the database community, which is one of the first communities
							to formalize provenance research,
							providing the theoretical foundations such as the widely adopted W3C PROV specifications.
							Recently provenance and visualization
							have been adopted to address core database challenges such as query, workflow, and
							dependency.
							There is a clear need to build closer connections between the two communities.

							The workshop’s main goals are:
						<ul>
							<li>To establish and improve the collaboration between the visualization and database
								community on provenance-related research through a discussion of challenges that span
								both communities;</li>
							<li>To further advance data provenance research within the database community to address the
								latest challenges, such as support for big data management, data processing, data
								sharing, or query optimization supported by provenance;</li>
							<li>To further advance analytic provenance research within the visualization community to
								address the latest challenges, such as support for machine learning and visualization
								reproducibility.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Computational notebooks have become an ubiquitous medium for much data science work. 
							At their best, computational notebooks acutalize Knuth's concept of literate programming with 
							their ability to weave code, text, and outputs, such as visuals, into a computational narrative.
							These notebooks support incremental and iterative analysis, explanation of an analyst's 
							thoughts and processes, and sharing of code, text, and visuals in one document.</p>
						<p>However, notebook systems are in their infancy in terms of user interface and interaction design.
							Recent research describes several pain points users of computational notebooks have, including 
							effectively managing more complex, non-linear data science and analysis workflows, messiness, 
							version control, debugging issues, making the most of larger, widescreen displays, and more.</p>
						<p>In this workshop, we seek to explore, catalogue, and innovate with respect to issues of user 
							interface and interaction design of computational notebooks.</p>

							<h3><span>Call for Participation</span></h3>
							<p>Calling all computational notebook and literate programming researchers! 
							We invite you to participate in a hybrid workshop at
							CHI aimed at bringing together researchers at the intersection of
							computational notebooks and HCI research, especially as it relates
							to interface and interaction design. We have multiple avenues for
							participation including papers, demonstrations, lightning talks, and
							attendance. To attend, please at a minimum fill out the form below
							with a position abstract related to computational notebooks and
							human-computer interaction. Position abstracts should be limited
							to 500 words, excluding references, and allow, but do not require,
							a lightning talk. Paper submissions should be of a length reflecting
							the contribution and in the ACM Conference Proceedings Primary
							Article Template format. Demo submissions should include an 
							online portal(s) (e.g. website, YouTube videos, etc.) showcasing what
							the submitter wishes to demonstrate. All submissions should be
							related to computational notebook research and computer-human
							interaction. Paper Submissions will be peer reviewed by a minimum
							of one organizer and two knowledgeable reviewers recruited by
							the organizers. Accepted papers and demos will be published on
							the workshop website. At least one author of each accepted 
							submission must attend the workshop, either in person or online. All
							participants must register for both the workshop and for at least
							one day of the conference.</p>
							<br>

							<h3><span>Scope of Topics</span></h3>
							<p>This workshop's main themes are
							centered around the following questions:
						<ul>
							<li>How can we improve the accessibility of relevant properties of computational notebooks, 
								such as kernel state, provenance, and more, through novel interface and interaction 
								design?</li>
							<li>How can we improve upon the Computational Notebook Metaphor for literate 
								programming, such as with alternative structures that support non-linearity in 
								analysis and narrative?</li>
							<li>How can computational notebooks exploit recent technological advances, such as those in 
								virtual and augmented reality, mobile devices, and artificial intelligence tools 
								like ChatGPT?</li>
							<li>How can computational notebooks more effectively assist collaborative data science 
								through methods such as best practices, novel interfaces and interactions?</li>
							<li>What challenges and opportunities exist for computational notebook use in the wild?</li>
							<li>How can we bridge the gap between computational notebook researchers, developers, and 
								end users?</li>
							<li>How can we better evaluate both the actual and the potential value of computational 
								notebooks and innovations to and/or for them?</li>

										Provenance </b>
									<p>
										In this talk he will survey work at the intersection of provenance (in databases)
										and visualization. He will discuss how visualization techniques may be essential
										in overcoming challenges in data provenance / explanations such as how to
										effectively communicate complex and large provenance graphs. Furthermore, he will
										argue that provenance techniques can be utilized to overcome challenges in
										visualization. e.g., by enabling fast refresh of updated visualizations and for
										helping users to contextualize visualizations through understanding how a
										visualization was produced. Furthermore, he will cover some recent research on
										using approximate provenance to speed-up query answering that can potentially be
										applied when refreshing visualizations.

										<b>Visualization KeyNote: Provenance as a Bridge Between Data Analysis
											Modalities </b>
										<p>
											In visualization, provenance is widely used for action recovery, to document
											analysis processes, and to analyze user behavior. In this talk, however, he
											will focus on an exciting application of provenance: to bridge between
											code-based and interactive and visual data analysis. Code-based and
											interactive data analysis have different strengths and weaknesses. Some
											operations can be more easily executed in one than in the other. Interactive
											visualization tends to be more “natural” and easier to understand, but
											code-based analysis is typically more reproducible. While traditionally
											these two approaches can’t be easily combined, He’ll show how we can leverage
											provenance data to tackle these issues and design a truly integrated
											analysis environment.
