						<p>Our ambition is to build this into a series of workshops, targeting a different research
							community outside visualization each year,
							and eventually create a provenance research network that connects all the relevant
							communities.</p>
						<p>For this year, we will target the database community, which is one of the first communities
							to formalize provenance research,
							providing the theoretical foundations such as the widely adopted W3C PROV specifications.
							Recently provenance and visualization
							have been adopted to address core database challenges such as query, workflow, and
							dependency.
							There is a clear need to build closer connections between the two communities.

							The workshop’s main goals are:
						<ul>
							<li>To establish and improve the collaboration between the visualization and database
								community on provenance-related research through a discussion of challenges that span
								both communities;</li>
							<li>To further advance data provenance research within the database community to address the
								latest challenges, such as support for big data management, data processing, data
								sharing, or query optimization supported by provenance;</li>
							<li>To further advance analytic provenance research within the visualization community to
								address the latest challenges, such as support for machine learning and visualization
								reproducibility.</li>

							<h3><span>Scope of Topics</span></h3>
							<p>While we are interested in any submissions at the intersection of provenance and
								visualization, we are especially focused on:

							<ul>
								<li>What can we learn when contrasting the problems of these two communities? Is there
									any visualization problem that can benefit from a database/analytic provenance
									method or vice versa?</li>
								<li>What are the most pressing provenance-related <b>challenges</b> in the database
									community? Is there any visualization-related solution to them? For example,
									<ul>
										<li>What <b>visualization techniques</b> may be used to assist the database
											community in <b>constructing retrospective and prospective provenance</b>
											that are more interactive, scalable, and user-friendly?</li>
								</li>How can <b>query languages</b> be supported from the standpoint of provenance and
								visualization?</li>
							</ul>
							<li>What are the opportunities for provenance in emerging visualization research areas such
								as <b>machine learning visualization</b> and <b>visualization reproducibility</b>? For
								example,</li>
							<ul>
								<li>How do we <b>show changes</b> to visualizations, interactions, or algorithms over
									time in various domains, including progressive visualizations, interactive
									visualizations, and machine learning training?</li>
								<li>How do we transparently and efficiently <b>share visualizations</b> and their
									production processes?</li>

									<b>Database KeyNote: Quid pro quo - Provenance for Visualization and Visualization
										for
										Provenance </b>
									<p>
										In this talk he will survey work at the intersection of provenance (in databases)
										and visualization. He will discuss how visualization techniques may be essential
										in overcoming challenges in data provenance / explanations such as how to
										effectively communicate complex and large provenance graphs. Furthermore, he will
										argue that provenance techniques can be utilized to overcome challenges in
										visualization. e.g., by enabling fast refresh of updated visualizations and for
										helping users to contextualize visualizations through understanding how a
										visualization was produced. Furthermore, he will cover some recent research on
										using approximate provenance to speed-up query answering that can potentially be
										applied when refreshing visualizations.

										<b>Bio: </b>Boris Glavic is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at

										areas of database systems and data science including data provenance, data
										integration, query execution and optimization, uncertain data, and data
										curation. Boris strives to build systems that are based on solid theoretical
										foundations.

										<b>Visualization KeyNote: Provenance as a Bridge Between Data Analysis
											Modalities </b>
										<p>
											In visualization, provenance is widely used for action recovery, to document
											analysis processes, and to analyze user behavior. In this talk, however, he
											will focus on an exciting application of provenance: to bridge between
											code-based and interactive and visual data analysis. Code-based and
											interactive data analysis have different strengths and weaknesses. Some
											operations can be more easily executed in one than in the other. Interactive
											visualization tends to be more “natural” and easier to understand, but
											code-based analysis is typically more reproducible. While traditionally
											these two approaches can’t be easily combined, He’ll show how we can leverage
											provenance data to tackle these issues and design a truly integrated
											analysis environment.

											where he and his team develop visualization methods and systems to help
											solve today’s scientific problems. Recently he is working on visualization
											accessibility, visual misinformation, provenance and reproducibility, and
											user study infrastructure. He is the recipient of an NSF CAREER award and
											multiple best paper awards or best paper honorable mentions at IEEE VIS, ACM
											CHI, and other conferences. He also received a best dissertation award from
